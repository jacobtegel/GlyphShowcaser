# LayerOverlayer

Overlay Layers!

LayerOverlayer is a stripped down and modified version of [GlyphShowcaser](https://github.com/jacobtegel/GlyphShowcaser) with the intent of overlaying all of your layers over each other. 
Whether that might be different versions, alternate drawings or something else, you can stack it and save it as a PDF, SVG or PNG.

Requires the [Drawbot extension for RoboFont](https://github.com/typemytype/drawBotRoboFontExtension).
